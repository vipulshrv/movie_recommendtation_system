Using dataset from movielens.

Content Based Filtering:
Content-based recommendation systems take into account the data provided by the user both directly and indirectly.Since content-based recommendations are based on usage patterns of a user, a user is often able to speculate why he/she is being shown a recommendation. This type of recommendation system relies on characteristics of the object. New content can be quickly recommended to the user. E.g. if the user has a history of watching all action movies, a newly released action movie is recommended by this system. However, this system does not take into account behavior/data about other users in the system hence, if a particular action movie fetches very low rating / negative recommendations by other users, It will still be recommended to the user.

User Based Collaberative Filtering:
Collaborative filtering is used to tailor recommendations based on the behavior of persons with similar interests. Sometimes it can be based on an item bought by the user. Since this method does not require a person himself to always contribute to a data store, and voids can be filled by the actions of other persons/ actions by the same person on other items. The similarities of the users is calculated by pearson's correlation.
